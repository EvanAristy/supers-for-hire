----- SUPERS FOR HIRE -----

----- PURPOSE -----

--- The idea of Supers For Hire was to have a company that would reach out to different superheros and super villains based on the clients needs. Having a large network of supers makes it easier for the client to come to us for a specific hero.  

----- TECHNOLOGIES -----

--- Used React App for the project. 
--- Used Bootstrap for the navbar, card components and login form.
--- Used React Beautiful DnD for the drag and drop features.
--- Used a button generator for some of the buttons.

----- PROBLEMS -----

--- I had major issues with the form select and would like to continue working with it to get it working. I ended up just using multiple buttons to filter through the arrays and render different categories. The drag and drop feature is a little buggy but it works for the most part. I just couldn't figure out how to remove the card from the list after it was dropped into another area. I would also like to continue working with DnD so that i can utilize it in the future.
